# Coursera-Getting-Cleaning-Data
Final project for course in Getting &amp; Cleaning Data!

In this repo, please find this read.me file, the code (run_analysis.R), the code book (CodeBook.md), and the final summary table (final.txt) with the means for each subject of the means and standard deviations (SD) of the data collected while performing each of 6 activities.

30 subjects were given smartphones that recorded the acceleration and angular velocity of the subject while performing each of six activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, laying). Many parameters were caluclated with these data.

The dataset for this class project was published by Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra, and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria_Gasteiz, Spain.
